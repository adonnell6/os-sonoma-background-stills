Stills from MacOS Sonoma High-Res Wallpaper videos

I wanted to use the new wallpaper images that come with MacOS Sonoma without having to live with a bunch of massive video files on my computer (I don't care about the moving screensaver; sorry Apple). So I downloaded them all, captured the first(ish) frame from each one (plus some bonus if I thought it was pretty) and shoved them all into a directory. Figured if somehow anyone stumbles across this it may save them a few hours of time.

This is only the wallpapers in the Landscape category.
